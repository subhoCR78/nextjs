Question - How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?

I think this needs to be revisited and re-modified . For eg- A support person is not used to github and deploy , so i questions and answers should be 
more of a PDF format and then reviewed i.e Support person can answer the questions in a sepcific timeframe and then send the PDF of the answers.
A person who needs to learn the product can learn the product after getting into the company. This is more a dev experience and will cause troubles for people from non-tech background.
Secondly clear instructions of deplying and creating a next JS project are not clear , this will cause many confusions.
